# To do list
This is a simple static To-Do List UI created using only HTML and CSS.

HTML is used to structure the web page, while CSS is used for styling, layout, and background design. 
No JavaScript is used, so the project focuses purely on frontend UI design.

Limitations

Since this project uses only HTML and CSS:

Tasks cannot be added dynamically

Tasks cannot be deleted

No data is stored

These features require JavaScript, which is intentionally not included.
